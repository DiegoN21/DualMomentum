# DualMomentum
In 2017 I read a book by Gary Antonacci entitled “Dual Momentum Investing”. If that happens you are not familiar with momentum, I would recommend it as an introductory text. In about two thirds of his book Gary rewiews and explains momentum in great detail. At the end the author proposes a variety of strategies under common name dual momentum, which basically combines absolute and relative momentums with the ultimate goal to enchance investment performance.

I think is a powerful strategy, pretty simple to implement and very efficient in terms of commission costs.

# Assets used in the strategy
I will used some of the assets that Gary Antonacci recommends, which are: 

IVV -> Equity USA
VEU -> International Equity ex USA
BND -> US Treasury Bonds Yield
BIL -> 1-3 Months US Treasury Bond Yield

# How does it works
The idea is simple and straightforward: invest in the asset that has the best relative and absolute momentum (check the page 98 of the book to see a schematic representation of the strategy).

# Extra Bonus
Also with the R-script for backtesting, you will find another script to know, each month, where to invest.

Enjoy and please share any improvements
